Movsar Omarov had created a game called Dark Blue. 
In this game as player you should gather all of the coins, without to touch lavas and to fall down.
There are different levels, whose map consist of lava, player, rock and coins. 
You can move player only with arrow keys.

The code is based on MVC-Pattern and Game Loop.
